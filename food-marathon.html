										<h3>The first Jackson Heights food marathon</h3>
										<p>A marathon is 42.195 kilometres (or 26.219 miles) long. Most people don't do a marathon to win.
											They run to finish and for the experience. The same is true for a food marathon.</p>
										<p>A food marathon is 42 dishes. To be fair, our marathon was a relay, because both of us ate 21 dishes.
											That's still <i>a lot</i> of food. We believe this is the first completed food marathon in Jackson Heights, Queens.
										  Yet it's not the first food marathon in New York City, for example, someone ate
											<a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/113907847/The-4-Hour-Chef-excerpt">26.2 dishes in Manhattan</a>.</p>

										<h3>Rules are simple</h3>
 										<p>Complete it by foot, within 24 hours, and, most importantly, have fun doing it.
											Moreover, it does not have to break the bank. We managed to stay under $150 for two people.</p>

										<h3>Location</h3>
										<p>Jackson Heights in Queens, New York City, is one of the most diverse neighborhoods in the United States
											if not the world. It's well documented as a dining destionation - just search for your favorite listicle.
											Home to large numbers of Colombians, Ecuadorians, Argentinians, Indians, Pakistanis, Tibetans, Nepalese, and Bangladeshis,
											we found an ideal base for our challenge.

										<p>The logistics of visiting 21 or more places are not trivial. We planned our tour as best we could with
											the power of a spreadsheet. A map helps to solve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">travelling salesman problem</a>.
											How can we minimize the walking distance between stops?</p>

										<h3>Marathon full report, 2016-07-16</h3>
										<h4>09:40 am</h4>
										<p> We start at Juju’s with an espresso and a mini-bagel. That was the right choice.</p>

										<h4>09:58 am</h4>
										<p>The sun is blazing. A predicted high of 32º Celsius and it seems like they will not be wrong.</p>

										<h4>09:59 am</h4>
										<p>We realise that several places are not open yet. A quick sidetour for Guatemalan tamales was in vain because it would take 25 min to make.</p>

										<h4>10:06 am</h4>
										<p>The stop at Patel Brothers was entertaining. We hope for a juice bar; probably a sign that we are already dehydrated. Two lychees and a sesame bar as loot.</p>

										<h4>10:11 am</h4>
										<p>We march onwards via two quick stops at Ka Baa and Haat Bazaar. The cold chicken patty was a lot more tasty than it sounds.
											The Bazaar didn’t have much of a selection, so we settled with a dilapi, fried sugar dough.</p>

										<span class="image right"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statzhero/tubemaus/master/images/food/tasty-food.JPG" alt="Tasty food" /></span>
										<h4>10:40 am</h4>
										<p>Next up are two places, Woodside Cafe and El Nuevo Izalco, but, oh no, they open in the afternoon.
											A grave oversight, so we improvise and head to Engeline’s. It's a good 20 min walk; time is of the essence.</p>

										<h4>11:52 am</h4>
										<p>On the way back we get side-tracked and get a freshly-pressed fruit juice. Liquid food counts, too.</p>

										<span class="image left"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statzhero/tubemaus/master/images/food/bhutanese.JPG" alt="Bhutanese Ema Datsi" /></span>
										<h4>12:07 pm</h4>
										<p>Ema Datsi surprises. First, we learn, that “ema datsi” is the national dish and that many  Bhutanese dishes
											involve cheese. It seems a strange time to eat here at noon. And the kitchen took more than half an hour
											for the dishes – perhaps they were heating up the oven. Regardless, the vegetarian pepper, cheese, soup, rice combo
											was fantastic. It is one thing to munch on a kebab at 3 am not-so-sober, but another to dig into a dish when
											you have been eating for hours.</p>

										<h4>01:43 pm</h4>
										<p>We round off the first part of the day with a portion of momos, Himalayan dumplings, from Lali Guras.
												The standard order is eight; we negotiate a deal with only four dumplings.</p>

										<h4>01:50 pm</h4>
										<p>Zzz. That's right, we take a siesta.</p>

										<h4>03:22 pm</h4>
										<p>Another long walk to Cannelle Patisserie. The beautiful pastries inside are in stark contrast
											with the gray stripmall and imminent flight path of La Guardia airport. We make several comments on how it
											exceeded expectations. It's as authentic as you probably will get for an French-American patisserie.</p>

										<h4>4:02 pm</h4>
										<p>The much-anticipated Spanish cheese import shop was a failure. We were two minutes too late for the 4 pm
											closing time. As the first drops from the sky appear, we hurry into Urubamba.</p>

										<h4>4:12 pm</h4>
										<p>Urubamba, the Peruvian sister restaurant to Jura, is probably the fanciest place on the list.
											With $18.25 (includes tips) also the priciest dish. The ceviche de pescado, however, provides a much welcomed
											diversity with the refreshing taste of lime and fish.</p>

										<h4>4:22 pm</h4>
										<p>At this point, we have our first struggle. Marthon runners speak of "hitting the wall". Hard proof for this
											comes in the form of a missing appetite for beer.</p>

										<h4>4:50 pm</h4>
										<p>Buenos Aires Bakery, our next stop, is another small gem. A tiny cannoli feels just right,
											but we also buy a custard pastry for later. The cannoli filling is somehow unconventional:
											a lightweight chocolate-cream. We also get another coffee, for good measure.</p>

										<h4>5:20 pm</h4>
										<p>Next up is Guadalajara de Noche, which is no more. In place is some seedy night bar,
											so we improvise with the Taco shop across the street. Of course, only after checking the, very favorable,
											reviews on Yelp. What it lacks in ambiance and cleanliness – there’s only a counter facing the street –
											it makes up with the tacos. A perfect balance of spices, vegetables, and protein.</p>

										<h4>5:42 pm</h4>
										<p>The next place, Louie’s pizza, turns out to be another highlight. Not feeling very hungry or
											confident at all, we go for a grandma slice (in true amateur spirit confusing it with a margherita slice).
											The thick, tomato-y, flavor-packed bread puts us in pizza heaven.
											“Let’s take half of it home”, turns into a clean plate in no time.</p>

										<span class="image right"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statzhero/tubemaus/master/images/food/taiwanese.JPG" alt="Terraza 7" /></span>
										<h4>6:20 pm</h4>
										<p>The walk in this part of the woods is quite interesting. Streets have names, for example.
											We head straight to the Taiwanese Gourmet restaurant. The establishment appears as a very authentic Taiwanese
											food place. Business is running strong, but we get a spot in the windowless basement.
											Our reward is a tasty beef noodle soup, the Taiwanese national dish according to Wikipedia.
											Naturally, we pair it with Taiwan beer. Not to be sneezed at are also the the nibbles on the table:
											roasted peanuts and some version of kimchi.</p>

											<h4>7:13 pm</h4>
											<p>Feeling very full the next stop at Lao Bei Fang’s dumpling house seems challenging.
												Luckily, the menu has one-dollar items, so we go all-in and order one corn steamed dumpling.
												Turns out, it has no filling. We conclude it's a place to revisit another time for their promising hand-stretched noodles.</p>

											<h4>7:30 pm</h4>
											<p>The final stop in this corner of Jackson Heights leaves us at the Sugar Club.
												It's a Thai mashup of dessert and grocery store, and we opt for some green tea ice cream.
												While the ice cream is of exquisite quality, our tastebuds are not particularly acquired
												with the taste of green tea ice cream. Something we both quickly remember.</p>

											<h4>8:00 pm</h4>
											<p>We retreat home for another break and debate the strategy for the rest of the evening.
												This is where things got interesting. Firstly, fatigue and a clear lack of appetite damp our motivation.
												Secondly, we are running out of places because of the closing times.</p>

											<h4>10:30 pm</h4>
											<p>As we walk up to our next place, we realize that there was no fun in trying further Indian or
												Himalayan places. Don’t get us wrong, they are delicious, just at some point we feel saturated.
												Tawa food, Kababish, and Amdo Kitchen are postponed to another day.</p>

												<h4>10:40 pm</h4>
												<p>We do not pass on the Arepa Lady, however. This Colombian restaurant has its own <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/15/dining/hungry-city-arepa-lady-in-elmhurst-queens.html">
												New York Times article</a>, so we can safely count them as the Jackson Heights “food establishment”.
												One cheese arepa based on chocolo, fresh ground corn meal, has a hint of sweet and is delicious.
												Add the sauces and it’s fantastic – another hit.</p>

												<span class="image left"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statzhero/tubemaus/master/images/food/terraza7.JPG" alt="Terraza 7" /></span>
												<h4>11:13 pm</h4>
												<p>At this point the food tour arguably descends into a pub crawl. We hit three more places:
													the Ready Penny Inn, the Pata Paplean, and the Terraza 7. All three are glorious bars but come in
													different flavors. The first, the Inn, is a dive bar. Think hipster style but without the hipsters.</p>

												<h4>00:18 am</h4>
												<p>Pata Paplean is a small Thai place that also serves food; we have a Muay cocktail (rum based).
													Not to be missed is the bathroom described in two words: <i>nerd disco</i>.</p>

												<h4>01:25 am</h4>
												<p>Terraza 7 is a tiny music venue on two levels. We are too late for the band, but the cocktails,
													Fandango (rum) and Chonto (pisco), are worth their money.</p>

												<h4>Ca. 02:30 am</h4>
												<p>We leave and call it a day (and night). The bed sounds exciting.</p>


										<h3>Tips for your marathon</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>Planning is crucial: the places at the fringes, morning and late night, are most at risk of being closed.</li>
											<li>Ensure diversity: the third chicken + rice combo won’t be very exciting and a perishing hunger is long gone.</li>
											<li>Smaller than small: share every meal and get the smallest size.</li>
											<li>Do it with someone else: needless to say that a solo-effort is less fun.</li>
											<li>Not finished? Take your leftovers with you, there's no shame in that. </li>
										</ul>
